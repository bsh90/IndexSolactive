# Getting Started

### Installation and Running the project
This application is made by gradle, springboot 3.3.4 and java 17. 
After installing the requirments, fun the application by `./gradlew bootRun`.

### Assumption while developing this application:
`GET / indexState` is a get request to show all the created and adjusted Indexes 
and need not additional calculation because the calculation was not mentioned in the document.

### Improvement in case of more time
More test coverage and code review by others would be two issues that I would have liked to do if I had more time.

### About the challenge
I very much enjoyed working on this project and I hope this would be helpful in recruiting in the company.
